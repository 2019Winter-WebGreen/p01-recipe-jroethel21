        <ul>

        <li>1/4 Cup of Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 Cups of Heavy Whipping Cream</li>

        <ul>
        
    <h2>Directions</h2>
<!-an ordered list describing the steps to make chocolate mousse-->
            
        <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs and sugar with mixer for about three minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 cup of heavy whipping cream in a small saucepan until just hot, not boiling. With mixer on low, pour the hot cream into egg mixture slowly until combined.</li>
        <li>Add the egg and cream mixture back into the saucepan and over low heat. Stir in chocolate until melted. Cover and refrigerate for two hours, until chilled, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>When the mixture is completely chilled and firm use your whisk attachment on your stand mixer to whip the remaining heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Remove chocolate from fridge and using the paddle attachment or a spoon fold/stir the whipped cream into the chocolate until incorporated and smooth. I found using the paddle attachment on low speed worked best.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Prep Time: 15 minutes + 2 hour chill time</p>
        
        <p>Perfect served alone or as a cake filling, cupcake topping, or layered dessert filling</p>
